## Why

Extends the official image of [Python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) for better use on CircleCI.

We aim to have CircleCI-extended images with ease of adoption of Docker and CircleCI. Once users are successful, we encourage them to build and customize images to suit their individual projects' needs.

## Experimental

CircleCI is experimenting with this image and may change it in the future in an incompatible way. Users should consider building their own image or pinning a specific `sha256` digest from this image in their CircleCI configuration file. For example:

```
docker:
  - image: redis@sha256:54057dd7e125ca41afe526a877e8bd35ec2cdd33b9217e022ed37bdcf7d09673
```
