## Why

Extends the official image of [PostgreSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) for better use on CircleCI.

We aim to have CircleCI-extended images ease adoption of Docker and CircleCI. Once users are successful, we encourage them to build and customize images to suit their individual projects' needs.

## Experimental

CircleCI is experimenting with this image and may change it in the future in an incompatible way. Users should consider building their own image or pinning a specific `sha256` digest from this image in their CircleCI configuration file.

## User Feedback

If you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us on [CircleCI's Discuss forum](https://discuss.circleci.com/c/circleci-2-0).
